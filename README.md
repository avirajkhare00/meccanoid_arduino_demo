# meccanoid_arduino_demo
This is an example for Meccanoid Arduino library.

To try it you'll need the following:
*Meccanoid G15 in its human form
*Any Arduino
*Motor shield or motor driver, to drive robot's wheels. I tried the one based on L293D and it was quite decent
*Tamiya Mini male connector with wires - to connect to the robots' battery
*Male connectors: CWF-2 to connect one motor and PLS-2 (it fits but not ideally, if you know the exact name of the connectors - please write me) to connect another
*3 resistors of 22 kOhm and 3 resistors of 1 kOhm - to make pullup resistors (according to the manual)
*Download the [library](http://cdn.meccano.com/open-source/meccanoid-library.zip)
*You can also check out the [reference material](http://cdn.meccano.com/open-source/Meccano_SmartModuleProtocols_2015.pdf), to understand, how do the Smart Modules work

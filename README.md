# meccanoid_arduino_demo
This is an example for Meccanoid Arduino library.

To try this example you'll need the following:
0) Meccanoid G15 in its human form
1) Any Arduino
2) Motor shield or motor driver, to drive robot's wheels. I tried the one based on L293D and it was quite decent
3) Tamiya Mini male connector with wires - to connect to the robots' battery
4) Male connectors: CWF-2 to connect one motor and PLS-2 to connect another
5) 3 resistors of 22 kOhm and 3 resistors of 1 kOhm - to make pullup resistors (according to the manual)
6) Download the library: http://cdn.meccano.com/open-source/meccanoid-library.zip
7) You can also check out the reference material, to understand, how do the Smart Modules work
